CambriaMath2TimesNewRoman

Quick use see the section of *How to use*

# Background
- The equatioequation editor in Word is quite convconvenient to use for the support of syntax based on LaTeX, however, the font applied in Word is Cambria, making it hard to meet the requirements of paper writhing that prefers to use Times New Roman.
- Having searched on inteinternet, but I failed fo find a method transforming Cambria into Times font. Inspired by the movement that many Chinese users replace Calibri font in OneNote, I developed this method.
# How to realize
- Get the orignal fonts: Times New Roman and Cambria Math in the *font* folder
- Download the software *font creator* (no higher than the version 13.0)
- Open Cambria Math and Times fonts with the software
- Replace the entries with those in Times New Roman
	- Tip: Before replace, you can sort the Glyps in both two fonts first in order to compare the difference between the two
	- I have only replaced the following 6 groups, enough for me.
- Export the new fonts (then open it and see are there any mistakes, sometimes the order will be wrong)
- Install the new font for all users, and delete the older Cambria in the setting of Microsoft.
- Reboot

# How to use
- Download the Cambria_2
